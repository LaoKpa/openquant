We are a financial machine learning library that will _always_ be open source.

## The different roles within the financial machine learning production chain:

1. **data curators** - collect/clean/index/store/adjust data to be delivered to production chain
2. **feature analysts** - transform raw data into informative signals 
3. **strategists** - informative features transformed into actual investment algorithms
4. **backtester** - assesses profitibility of a given strategy under various scenarios
5. **deployment team** - integrate strategy code into production line

## Here is what we believe (in-progress):

1. Financial Machine Learning tools should be available for free
